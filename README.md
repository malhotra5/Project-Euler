# Project-Euler
Solutions to all the problems I have worked on.
## Getting started
All these problems are purely algorithmic in nature. They are all written from scratch.
### Prerequisites
* Math (provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard)
### Installation
*No intallation is required. Math is already provided when python is downloaded.*
